You can visit my [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nK4y3Kl3Tw-wNLXcw7hM0FKhXHQkiqlg?usp=sharing) direclty if you don't plan to run the code yourself of modify it.

## Objective
This project aims to participate in a Kaggle competition. In some alarming tweets, people are warning others from disasters. But sometimes it might be a metaphor, "Look the sky is ablase" talking about sunset... Our deep learning algorithm will have to differenciate between regular tweets and disaster ones. 

The technical goal of this project is to:
- do all the NLP preprocessing
- code neural networks using Tensorflow Keras

## Deliverables
The goal is to deliver a sumbission file predicting labels for the test set.


## Dataset
* [Dataset on Kaggle (train.csv and test.csv are required)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview/description)

## Prerequisites
### Dependencies
- The source code is written in Python 3.
- The python packages can be installed with pip : `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
Place train.csv and test.csv in the same file as the notebook. Run the notebook linearly.
